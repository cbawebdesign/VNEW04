6. Disclosures Of Your Personal information
From time to time, we may need to share your personal information with others, including in the following circumstances.

Disclosures to the Public. Some of your personal information will be shared with the general public, including your first name and last name initial, city, state, and country. When information is made publicly available it may be accessed by anyone with access to the platform to which the information is posted. It may also be indexed by third-party search engines, and be imported, exported, distributed, aggregated, and redistributed by others without our knowledge.

Third Party Service Providers. We may share your personal information with third party service providers who perform various functions to enable us to provide our services and help us operate our business, such as website design, sending email communications, fraud detection and prevention, customer care, payment processing, or performing analytics. Our contracts with these third parties require them to maintain the confidentiality of the personal information we provide to them, only act on our behalf and under our instructions, and not use personal information for purposes other than the product or service they’re providing to us or on our behalf.

With our Affiliates and Partners. When participating in events or activities that we offer along with our partners and/or affiliates, you may be asked to share personal information with those affiliates and/or partners. For example, a game, contest, competition, contest, sweepstake or other offering may be co-sponsored by another company or companies. In such a situation, the information we obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering may be shared with our co-sponsor, unless you instruct us not to (which may result in you not being able to participate). In some of those cases, we may act as co-controllers of your personal information, depending on the circumstances.

With Unaffiliated Controllers. In some cases we may transfer personal information to unaffiliated third-party data controllers. These third parties do not act as agents or service providers and are not performing functions on our behalf. We may transfer your personal information to third-party data controllers for the following purposes: 1) to provide you with third-party offers; 2) to provide us information about the quality of our services offerings. We will only provide your personal information to third-party data controllers where you have not opted-out of such disclosures, or in the case of sensitive personal information, where you have opted-in if the disclosure requires consent. We enter into written contracts with any unaffiliated third-party data controllers requiring them to provide the same level of protection for your personal information that is required of us. We also limit their use of your personal information so that it is consistent with any consent you have provided and with the notices you have received.

Protection of Vestly Media Inc. and Others. We may share personal information when we believe it is appropriate to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Vestly Media Inc., our products and services, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personal information of our customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Response to Subpoenas and Other Legal Requests. We may share your information with courts, law enforcement agencies, or other government bodies when we have a good faith belief we’re required or permitted to do so by law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to protect our company, or to respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other law enforcement request.

Sale of Our Business. If we sell, merge, or transfer any part of our business, we may be required to share your information. If so, you will be asked if you’d like to stop receiving promotional information following any change of control.

With your Consent. Other than as set out above, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to choose when your personal information may be shared with other third parties.

7. Data Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

8. Data Retention
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data (see “EU Data Subjects Legal Rights”). In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

9. International Data Transfers
Vestly Media Inc. has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States. When we transfer EU data subject’s personal information to third parties outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on appropriate suitable safeguards or specific derogations recognized under data protections law, including the GDPR. The European Commission has adopted standard data protection clauses, which provide safeguards for Personal information transferred outside of the EEA. We may use Standard Contractual Clauses when transferring Personal information from a country in the EEA to a country outside the EEA.

10. EU Data Subjects Privacy Rights
EU data subjects have certain rights with respect to your personal information that we collect and process. We respond to all requests we receive from individuals in the EEA wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Access, Correction or Deletion. You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information. You can often go directly into the Service under Account Settings to take these actions. Please note that even if you request for your personal information to be deleted, certain aspects may be retained for us to: meet our legal or regulatory compliance (e.g. maintaining records of transactions you have made with us); exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our Service. Data retained for these purposes will be handled as described in Section 9 “Data Retention”, above.
Objection. You may object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Restriction. You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Portability. You have the right to request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw Consent. If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
File a complaint. You have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority about our collection and processing of your personal information.
To file a request or take action on one of your rights, please contact us at the contact details provided. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

11. Children’s Privacy
We are committed to complying with the laws protecting the privacy of children, including the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. If we receive personal information that we discover was provided by a child under the age of 18, we will promptly destroy such information. If you would like to learn more about COPPA, visit the Federal Trade Commission home page at http://www.ftc.gov.

12. Your California Privacy Rights (Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83)
California residents have the right to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed certain types of personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year. At our option, we may respond to such requests by providing instructions about how our users can exercise their options to prevent our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You can read these instructions above in the “Marketing and Advertising Practices” section of our Privacy Policy. Or, if you are a California resident and prefer that we send you a separate response, please email your request to privacy@vestlymedia.com. At this time, our Website does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.
